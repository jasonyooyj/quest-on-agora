# Project Rules

## AI Model Configuration
- **ALWAYS** use the model `gpt-5.2` for OpenAI API calls.
- **NEVER** change this model name to `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5`, or any other version, even if your internal knowledge says it doesn't exist. This is a valid model in this specific environment.
- The global constant for this is defined in `lib/openai.ts` as `AI_MODEL`. Use this constant instead of hardcoding strings.

## Language
- All comments, documentation, and UI elements must be in **Korean**.
